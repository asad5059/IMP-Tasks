## Problem Description:
We are looking to create a Java-based API that will use the Google Drive API to preview files.

Initially, this API will take a spreadsheet file, upload it to Google Drive and return a preview URL in the API response.

The objective is to allow users to preview spreadsheets in Google Sheets using a service account, not individual user oauth accounts.
